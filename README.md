# cw12-employee-tracker

## Description
A command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
This application will help organizations manage their employee database and easily track and make changes as the need arises. I learnt how to join tables with IDs and link data together from different table. I also got a better understanding of asynchronous queries.

## Installation
The user will clone the project and run the command line npm i on the terminal to install required packages. The user starts the app by typing employeetracker.js on the command line.

## Technologies Used
Node.js, Inquirer, Mysql2, schema.sql, seeds.sql

## Usage
After installing the packages, the user runs employyetracker.js on the command line then follows the instruction. The user uses the arrow keys to select options and to initiate the menu options again after an output is received.
